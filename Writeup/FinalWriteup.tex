\section{Abstract}



The two-dimensional Hubbard model has attracted sustained scientific interest for decades, largely because of its ability to capture most of the underlying physics of the superconducting phase of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors\cite{dagotto1994correlated}. 
Beyond its relevance to the cuprates, it also serves as a fundamental toy model in theoretical physics. 
This thesis conducts a detailed analysis of the 2D Hubbard model using the truncated-unity functional Renormalisation Group (TU$^2$FRG) method,
within the framework of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.  The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity is explored 
by systematically varying model parameters such as the on-site Coulomb repulsion, chemical potential, Hund's coupling, next-nearest-neighbor hopping, and the number of orbitals per
site. This approach enables the identification of clear trends in the superconducting critical ($T_c$) temperature and order parameter, while also
providing insights into the magnetic ordering and how well FRG works for a certain range of parameters.





\section{Introduction}

Since its discovery in 1911\cite{onnes1911superconductivity}, superconductivity has remained a topic of great scientific interest.
This phenomenon, characterised by an abrupt drop in resistance at a so-called ``Critical Temperature ($T_c$)"\cite{geballe2015tc} is driven by an attractive interaction
between electrons. This  interaction leads to the formation of electron pairs, famously known as ``Cooper pairs"\cite{schrieffer2018theory}. For many 
years after the discovery of superconductivity, physicists
were convinced that BCS-Eliashberg-electron-phonon theory \cite{schrieffer2018theory} provided a complete explanation of the electron pairing mechanism in all superconducting materials. 
However, in 1979, the discovery of the first heavy-fermion superconductor\cite{steglich1979superconductivity} gave rise to a whole new class of materials: Unconventional Superconductors. 
These are condensates of cooper pairs formed by a different pairing mechanism than the electron-phonon coupling predicted by BCS theory\cite{hirsch2015superconducting}.
For many materials, there is no consensus on what the mechanism otherwise is.\par

\medskip
\noindent High-temperature superconductors are a special class of unconventional superconductors. They are defined by having a critical temperature greater than the boiling point 
of Nitrogen (77K). Ever since the discovery of the first high-$T_c$ superconductor\cite{bednorz1986possible}, the search for ``(close to-) room temperature" superconductors has been extended to 
all kinds of unconventional superconductors. However, a comprehensive understanding of what drives the superconductivity is required in order 
to achieve this. There have been multiple attempts to model the pairing mechanism of some families of high-$T_c$ superconductors, most of which have
been greatly limited by the numerical challenges that working with complex lattice structures present.\par 

\medskip
\noindent Motivated by these challenges and by the need for simplified yet insightful models, this work turns to the two-dimensional Hubbard model-one of the most fundamental frameworks in condensed matter physics. Truncate Unity Functional Renormalisation Group (TU$^2$FRG)\cite{eckhardt2020truncated} is employed to 
investigate the influence of the Coulomb repulsion ($U$) and chemical potential ($\mu$) on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.
This is done under the key assumption that superconductivity arises from spin-fluctuation mediation.
In this work, regions of stable magnetic and superconducting order are identified, and trends in their respective ordering and critical temperatures are presented.
The study is further extended by examining how variations in the next-nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude and the inclusion of a second orbital per site impact all of the above.





\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Unconventional superconductivity}

\noindent Most generally, the Hamiltonian for a superconducting state can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{General Hamiltonian}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}^0 + \hat{H}^{cp}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat{H}^{cp}$ describes the pairing interaction that leads to the formation of a Cooper pair and is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{Hcp}
    \hat{H}^{cp} = \sum_{k,k'} \Gamma(k, k') c^{\dagger}_{k, \uparrow}  c^{\dagger}_{k', \downarrow} c_{k', \uparrow}c_{-k, \downarrow}
\end{equation}

\noindent In s-wave symmetric superconductors, the effective pairing interaction $\Gamma(k,k')$ is momentum-independent and thus remains constant. 
For many unconventional superconductors-including those with spin-fluctuation mediated pairing-the exact form of $\Gamma(k,k')$ has remained as an unanswered question for decades. 
\subsubsection{Spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity}
\label{subsec:spinfluct}

The prevailing assumption for the pairing mechanism in Iron-based or heavy-fermion compounds 
is that it is driven by spin fluctuations \cite{moriya2000spin}. This section discusses how to
model spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity for the fluctuation-exchange approximation (FLEX) \cite{esirgen1997fluctuation}. \par
\medskip
\noindent In such cases, the effective pairing interaction $\Gamma(k,k')$ is given by \footnote{Note that this form of pairing interaction 
assumes that the ratio between 
the fluctuation frequence ($w_f$) and the Fermi energy is small.}:

\begin{equation}\label{Pairing interaction SF}
    \Gamma(k,k') = \frac{3}{2} U^2 \chi^S(k-k') -\frac{1}{2}U^2 \chi^C(k-k') + U
\end{equation} 

\noindent This equation is taken from \cite{migdal1958interaction}. Here, U is the on-site Coulumb repulsion and $\chi^S$, $\chi^C$ are the interacting spin-susceptibilities in the Charge (C) and Spin(S) channel respectively. Their form is given below.

\begin{equation}
    \chi^S(q) = \frac{\chi^0(q)}{1 - U \chi^0 (q)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \chi^C(q) = \frac{\chi^0(q)}{1 + U \chi^0 (q)}
\end{equation}

\noindent These interacting spin susceptibilities are expressed in terms of the non-interacting dynamic spin susceptibility ($\chi_{ps}^0$)\cite{moriya2000spin}, stated below: 

\begin{equation}\label{chi 0}
    \chi_{ps}^0(q, i \omega) = -\sum_{k} \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau G^0_{ps}(k+q \tau) G^0_{sp}(k, -\tau)e^{i\omega \tau}
\end{equation} 

\noindent The calculations presented in this project are carried out in the spin-fluctuation framework. 
Whilst this theory has managed to successfully capture key features in the phase diagrams of unconventional superconductors, it also has its limitations.
The most relevant example is that of the cuprate phase diagram:
spin-fluctuation theory is able to capture the superconducting dome and the correct order parameter \cite{moriya2006developments, scalapino1995case} 
but fails
to describe the characteristic pseudo-gap and Mott insulating phase\cite{timusk1999pseudogap}.


\subsection{Hubbard-Kanamori Model}

\subsubsection{Tight binding Models}

The Tight Binding Model is a central element of condensed matter physics \eqref{TBM}. In this model, electrons are bound in orbitals around the lattice ions.
Due to the overlap between the quantum mechanical wave-functions that describe these orbitals, electrons are allowed to 'hop' to neighbouring sites. The probability that this hopping process will occur is given by a tunnelling amplitude, which can be calculated using a hopping integral. \par
\medskip
\noindent This work is carried out in the tight-binding framework, where the magnitude of the tunnelling amplitudes is at first treated as a free parameter. 
The starting point is a simple nearest-neighbour hopping tight binding model. 
The effect of introducing a next-nearest-neighbour hopping and an extra orbital per site
is then investigated \textit{(See Fig. \ref{fig:2D Hubbard model})}.



\begin{equation} \label{TBM}
    \hat{H}_{TB}(\b{R}) = \sum_{ij\sigma} t_{ij}(\hat{c}_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c)
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:2D Hubbard model}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Hubbard Model}
\label{subsec: HubbardModel}

The  tight binding model as defined above fails to account for any interactions between electrons. This motivates the extension of this model to the Hubbard model \eqref{t Hubbard model}, which includes the (onsite) Coulomb repulsion between electrons. Despite its simple form, this model can describe very rich physical phenomena.
In particular, it becomes very interesting to study when the Coulomb repulsion ($U$) and the nearest neighbour hoping ($t$) are of comparable order, since it highlights the competing phenomena that take place in correlated systems. 
The 2D Hubbard model is able to predict all sorts of correlated phases: it describes metals, insulators, superconductors and other exotic phases\cite{white1989numerical,hirsch1985two, anderson1990luttinger,sun2011nearly}. 
This model has been widely studied since it resembles the structure of the Cuprate high-temperature superconductors \cite{dagotto1994correlated}. 




\begin{equation}\label{t Hubbard model}
    \hat{H} = \sum_{ij\sigma} -t_{ij}(\hat{c}_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{j \sigma} + h.c) 
    + U \sum_{i} \hat{n}_{i \uparrow} \hat{n}_{i \downarrow}
\end{equation}





\subsubsection{Hubbard-Kanamori Model}
\label{subsubsec: HKmodel}
In the case of materials with a multi-band and/or multi-orbital nature, the Hubbard model is not sufficient to capture all physical phenomena. This motivates the extension of the Hubbard model to the Hubbard-Kanamori model\cite{sherman2020hubbard} by including a Hund's coupling term.

\begin{equation} \label{Hubbard-Kanamori Model}
    H_{int} = U \sum_{is}n_{i,s\uparrow}n_{i,s\downarrow} + \frac{V}{2} \sum_{i,s,t \neq s} n_{is}n_{it} -\frac{J}{2} \sum_{i,s,t \neq s} \vec{S}_{is} \cdot \vec{S}_{it} 
    + \frac{J'}{2} \sum_{i,s,t \neq s} \sum_{\sigma} c_{is\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{is\bar{\sigma}}^{\dagger}c_{it\bar{\sigma}}c_{it\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, $U$ and $V$ represent the electronic interactions in the same and different orbitals respectively. For generality, the intraorbital exchange $J$ and the 'pair hopping' term $J'$ following from Hund's rule coupling have been separated.  
Note that this Hamiltonian is relevant for the later section of this project, where the model is extended to a two-orbital, two-dimensional Hubbard model.

\subsection{Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) theory}

Solving the Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian is rather challenging, which is why one resorts to numerical techniques such as FRG. FRG falls into the same category of many other weak-coupling techniques (such as Mean field-theory\cite{kadanoff2009more}, pertubation theory\cite{nagaosa2013quantum}, Density Functional theory\cite{kohn1965self} or Random Phase approximation\cite{bohm1951collective}).
In these theories, interactions between electrons are considered to be weak. This allows one to effectively model the electrons in the system as free particles 
and treat their interactions as a pertubation. In the non-interacting limit, the method is therefore exact. Beyond this limit, the method's precision is controlled by the ratio between the interaction
strength and the bandwidth of the system. \par

\medskip

\noindent The behavior of interacting electrons is strongly influenced by the energy scale. In the FRG approach, the degrees of freedom corresponding to different energy scales are treated successively, 
progressing step-by-step from higher to lower energies.
Metaphorically, FRG functions like a microscope with adjustable resolution: one begins with a detailed, high-resolution view of the fundamental microscopic laws and gradually lowers the resolution to arrive at a coarse-grained description of macroscopic collective phenomena.
\medskip

\noindent In this section the theoretical framework for FRG calculations is outlined. The central element of FRG is a flow equation that describes the evolution of the effective action of the system with respect to a scalar/flow parameter Lambda ($\Lambda$) \textit{(See section~\ref{subsubsec:Flow Equation})}.
The flow equation can be solved exactly for a limited number of systems, so in most scenarios an approximation has to be made in order to reach a solution in a reasonable computational time.  
For the systems explored in this project only two-particle
interactions are considered and any higher order terms are neglected.
This allows the separation of the effective action of the system into three terms. Each term represents one of the following three physical channels: Superconductivity, Spin-Density and Charge-Density Waves.
The calculation is then performed to determine the first to diverge and hence "winning channel", this will correspond to the respective physical ground state that the model exhibits. This rather conceptual overview of FRG is represented in a flowchart below \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:FRGflowdiagram})}.

    \caption{\textbf{FRG Flowchart:} Schematic illustration of the TU$^2$FRG calculation process.
     The procedure begins by truncating the flow equation to two-particle interactions. 
     This allows for the separation of the effective action into three distinct ``physical" channels. 
     Each channel is then computed independently, and the dominant phase is identified as the 
     one in which the corresponding channel diverges.}
    \label{fig:FRGflowdiagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Flow equation}
\label{subsubsec:Flow Equation}

In this section the derivation of the flow equation is outlined. 
If interested in the finer details of the derivation, the reader is referred to \cite{metzner2012functional}. \par
\medskip
\noindent The central elements of statistical physics are the partition function, the canonical potential and its Legendre transformations. 
These are such powerful physical quantities that one can derive all physical observables from them.
For quantum many-body problems, one works instead with partition functional, defined as follows in Eq.\ref{partition functional}:

\begin{equation}\label{partition functional}
    \mathcal{Z}[\bar{\eta}, \eta] = \int \mathcal{D} \bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi e^{\mathcal{S}[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}e^{(\bar{\eta}, \psi)+(\eta, \bar{\psi})}
\end{equation}

\noindent In the case of fermionic systems, the action in the exponent of Eq.\ref{partition functional} takes the form shown below.
\begin{equation} \label{action}
    \mathcal{S}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] = -(\bar{\psi}, G_0^{-1} \psi) + V[\psi, \bar{\psi}]
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, $V[\psi, \bar{\psi}]$ is an arbitrary many-body interaction and $G_0$ represents the propagator of the non-interacting system. 
This equation contains the shorthand notation ``$(...)$", which represents the sum $\sum_x \bar{\psi}(x)(G_0^{-1}\psi)(x), (G_0^{-1}\psi)(x) = \sum_{x’}G_0^{-1}(x,x’)\psi(x’)$. In this sum, the Grassman field index $x$ encodes all the quantum numbers of the single-particle basis and imaginary time.\par
\medskip

\noindent Note that in the limiting case where $V=0$, the path integral in Eq.\ref{partition functional} is exactly solvable. 
However, the situation becomes considerably more intricate when electronic correlations are taken into account.
The main idea behind FRG is to introduce a cut-off in the non-interacting Green's function ($G_0 \rightarrow G_0^{\lambda} = f(\lambda)G_0$). 
This cutoff is then interpolated between the solvable initial state and the full path integral solution by subsequently including electronic interactions. For a spin-independent system this would transform the 
bare propagator as shown in Equations (\ref{propagator transform 1}) and (\ref{propagator transform 2}). 

\begin{equation} \label{propagator transform 1}
    G_0(k_0, \textbf{k}) \rightarrow G_0^{\lambda}(k_0, \textbf{k})
\end{equation}


\begin{equation} \label{propagator transform 2}
    \frac{1}{ik_0 - \xi_{\textbf{k}}} \rightarrow \frac{\theta^{\textbf{k}}}{ik_0 - \xi_{\textbf{k}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\theta^{\lambda}(\textbf{k})$ is defined, for example, as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{theta def}
    \theta^{\lambda}(\textbf{k}) = \Theta(|\xi_{\textbf{k}}| - \lambda)    
\end{equation}

\noindent With this particular choice of cutoff scheme, the calculation then excludes points close to the Fermi Surface \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:Truncation})}. \par
\begin{figure}[htbp]  % Placement: Here, Top, Bottom, Page
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Truncation.png}  % Adjust width as needed
    \caption{\textbf{Cut-off scheme example:} Momentum space region (shaded in grey) around the Fermi-surface (red) that is excluded 
    by a momentum cut-off for a 2D square lattice. Taken from \cite {metzner2012functional}}.
    \label{fig:Truncation}
\end{figure}

\medskip
\noindent In the following steps the derivation will proceed in the framework of the  so-called ``effective action"\footnote{If interested in why see Ref. \cite{metzner2012functional}}  ($\mathcal{T}[\psi, \bar{\psi}]$).
This is the Legendre transformation of the Greens function functional ($\mathcal{G}[\eta, \bar{\eta}]$), defined below in Equations (\ref{Effective action})  and  (\ref{Greens function functional}, \ref{G term in effective action}) respectively. 


\begin{equation} \label{Greens function functional}
    \mathcal{G}[\eta, \bar{\eta}] = -ln(\mathcal{Z}[\eta, \bar{\eta}])
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{G term in effective action}
    \mathcal{G}[\eta, \bar{\eta}] = 
    -ln \int{\mathcal{D}\psi \mathcal{D} \bar{\psi}e^{-\mathcal{S}[\psi, \bar{\psi}]}e^{(\bar{\eta}, \psi) +(\bar{\psi}, \eta)}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{Effective action}
    \mathcal{T}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] = (\bar{\eta},\psi) + (\bar{\psi},\eta) + \mathcal{G}[\eta, \bar{\eta}]
\end{equation}


\noindent The next step is to introduce a scalar flow parameter ($\lambda$) into the generating functionals defined above. This is done in the same manner as outlined in the example shown in Equations \ref{propagator transform 1} $\&$ \ref{propagator transform 2}. 
But, more generally, this has to be performed such that the generators recover their original structure at $\lambda = 0 $.
After a series of algebraic manipulations, which are omitted here but can be found in \cite{metzner2012functional}, one arrives at the exact functional flow equation for the effective action:


\begin{equation} \label{eq:ExactFunctionalFlowEquation}
    \frac{d}{d\Lambda} \mathcal{T}^{\Lambda}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] = (\bar{\psi}, \dot{Q}_0^{\Lambda} \psi) - \frac{1}{2} \text{tr} \big( \dot{Q}_0^{\Lambda} (\boldsymbol{\Gamma}^{(2)\Lambda}[\psi, \bar{\psi}])^{-1} \big).
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\Gamma^{(2)\lambda}[\psi, \bar{\psi}]$ and  $\textbf{Q}_0^{\Lambda}$ are given by equations (\ref{Gamma term}) and (\ref{Q0 term }) respectively.



\begin{equation}\label{Gamma term}
\Gamma^{(2)\lambda}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\bar{\delta} \delta \Gamma[\psi, \bar{\psi}](x',x) & \bar{\delta} \bar{\delta} \Gamma[\psi, \bar{\psi}](x',x) \\
\delta \delta \Gamma[\psi, \bar{\psi}](x',x)  & \delta \bar{\delta} \Gamma[\psi, \bar{\psi}](x',x)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}\label{Q0 term }
\b{Q}_0^{\Lambda} =
\begin{bmatrix}
Q_0^{\Lambda} & 0 \\
0 & -Q_0^{\Lambda t}
\end{bmatrix}
= diag(Q_0^{\Lambda}, - Q_0^{\Lambda t}),
\end{equation}

\noindent $\Gamma^{(2)\lambda}$ and $\b{Q}_0^{\Lambda}$ are given by the reciprocal 
of the Green's and non-interacting Green's function respectively.
The key point is that the Flow equation is well-defined. 
This flow equation is the central element of FRG and the sections below outline how to solve it.


\subsubsection{Truncation scheme (TU$^2$FRG)}
\label{subsubsec:Truncation scheme}


The flow equation derived above can be solved exactly only for a small class of systems; for most models, Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) 
calculations are highly computationally expensive.
In order to tackle this issue, the truncated unity approximation (TU$^2$FRG) was introduced in 2017\cite{lichtenstein2017high} and later improved in 2020\cite{eckhardt2020truncated}. 
The main idea behind this scheme is to find a new basis that, with a controlled loss of accuracy, can represent all 
required elements in a compressed way. It can be shown that such a basis can be constructed and is 
well-defined in the case where the calculation is constrained to terms in the order of U$^{2}$ \textit{(two-particle interactions)}\cite{lichtenstein2018functional}.
Partitions of unity \footnote{These can be essentially regarded as delta functions in momentum and real space. Their exact form can be found in \cite{lichtenstein2018functional}.} are then introduced into a specific part of the flow equation. This reduces an otherwise computationally expensive nested integral to a matrix product.\par
\medskip

\noindent Whilst the truncated scheme presents advantages in computational efficiency, particularly for lattice models with broken translational symmetry, it also has its limitations. 
TU$^2$FRG relies on short-range interactions, thus struggling to capture strongly correlated phases. 
This is particularly relevant for the study of the 2D Hubbard model. TU$^2$FRG will not be able to capture
the characteristic Mott insulating phase of the Cuprate phase diagrams\cite{imada1998metal}, which limits how well the results presented in this project can be directly compared with existing literature. 
More importantly, the truncation scheme has a direct consequence on the accuracy of the predicted phase transition temperature ($T_c$). Whilst it is able to correctly capture
the trends in $T_c$, the values predicted are much higher than what is reasonable to expect in real materials \textit{(These unphysically large values are expected to decrease if higher order particle interactions are included)}.
Nevertheless, TU$^2$FRG successfully captures the competition between magnetic and superconducting instabilities, a central focus of the results presented in this project. 
\subsubsection{Decoupling of flow equation}
After constraining ourselves to the case of two-particle interactions in the framework of translationally invariant systems, one can decouple the two-particle coupling as a function of the flow parameter ($\lambda$) into three channels:

\begin{equation} \label{V decoupling}
    V(k1,k2,k3,k4)= V_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4}^{(0)} - \phi^{P}_{k_1 +k_2, \frac{k_1 - k_2}{2}, \frac{k_4-k_3}{2}} + \phi^{C}_{k_1 - k_3, \frac{k_1 +k_3}{2}, \frac{k_2+k_4}{2}} +\phi^{D}_{k_3- k_2, \frac{k_1 + k_4}{2}, \frac{k_2+k_3}{2}}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, the three channels correspond to a particle-particle, crossed particle-hole and (three) direct particle-hole terms. These are strongly related to their respective effective actions (\ref{con1}-\ref{con}). They represent all possible ways in which two particle can interact in the correlated system. The particle-particle (P), cross-particle-hole (C) and direct-particle-hole (D) channels
correspond to the Superconducting, Charge and Magnetic phases respectively. 

\begin{equation}\label{con1}
    \dot{\phi}^{P}_{k_1 +k_2, \frac{k_1 - k_2}{2}, \frac{k_4-k_3}{2}} = - \mathcal{T}_{pp}(k1,k2,k3)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}\label{con2}
    \dot{\phi}^{C}_{k_1 - k_3, \frac{k_1 +k_3}{2}, \frac{k_2+k_4}{2}} = - \mathcal{T}_{cr-ph}(k1,k2,k3)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{con}
    \dot{\phi}^{D}_{k_3- k_2, \frac{k_1 + k_4}{2}, \frac{k_2+k_3}{2}} = - \mathcal{T}_{d-ph}(k1,k2,k3)
\end{equation}

\noindent The decoupling outlined above enables the treatment of the effective action as a separable object:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{T}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] = \mathcal{T}_{pp}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] + \mathcal{T}_{ph}[\psi, \bar{\psi}] + \mathcal{T}_{cph}[\psi, \bar{\psi}]
\end{equation}

\medskip





\subsubsection{Instability calculation}

This section provides an outline of the procedure following the decoupling the effective action and flow equation, for more details the reader is referred to\cite{profe2023functional}. 
In the TU$^2$FRG method, the resulting decoupled flow equation is solved through nested integration, involving both a coarse momentum integration and a
refined integration around each $k$ point.  This calculation yields the self-energy and the two particle vertex\footnote{For precise definitions of these quantities, see \cite{metzner2012functional}.}.
Although these quantities are not directly measurable, they serve as the foundation for further analysis. The first post-processing step involves
identifying which of the three interaction channels diverges, revealing the leading susceptibility. Mean-field analysis\cite{reiss2007renormalized} is then performed at the critical scale in order to determine the ordering symmetry 
and derive a linearized gap equation for the superconducting channel\footnote{The equation here is expressed in terms of the Greens functional $G$ and vertex function $F$. Note that this form of linearised gap equation is valid for a small gap magnitude. }
\textit{(See equation \ref{gapeq})}\cite{profe2023functional}. From this one can compute 
the superconducting gap and order parameter.

\begin{equation}\label{gapeq}
    \Delta = aF(GG)|_{\Delta = 0}\Delta
\end{equation}



\section{Computational Methods}

After having discussed the required theoretical background, the implementation of the necessary concepts within the framework of
this project is now addressed. The primary goal is to obtain a computational solution 
for the 2D Hubbard-(Kanamori) model, utilizing the divERGe package. This package implements the TU$^2$FRG
formalism discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:Truncation scheme}.
All calculations are conducted within the framework of spin-fluctuation mediated 
superconductivity \textit{(see Section \ref{subsec:spinfluct})}, focusing solely on  
electronic interactions and neglecting other instabilities, such as lattice 
instabilities (e.g. charge density waves or phonon-mediated superconductivity). 
This section provides an overview of the divERGe package, together with the convergence
tests required to ensure the accuracy of the results. 

\subsection{divERGe}
\label{subsec:diverge}




\noindent divERGe is an open-source, high-performance, C/C++/Python library that includes a truncated unity FRG (TU$^2$FRG) computational backend\cite{profe2024diverge}. 
At the core of the truncated-unity calculation is a model that incorporates all the essential physical parameters. This model must accurately reflect the system's kinematics, based on its real-space hopping parameters.
It is equally important to define structural details such as the Bravais lattice vectors, the number of atoms per unit cell, 
and the number of orbitals per atom. Once the model is established, six input parameters must be specified for the calculation to proceed: 
the strengths of the Coulomb repulsion ($U$) and Hund’s coupling ($J$), the value of the chemical potential ($\mu$), as well as the form factor cut-off, $n_k$ and $n_{k_f}$
values. \textit{(The latter three terms are depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:nknkf} and discussed in more detail in Section \ref{subsec:convergence})}.\par
\medskip
\noindent With the model constructed and all necessary parameters defined, 
the calculation can proceed. Under the approximations described in Section \ref{subsubsec:Truncation scheme},
the flow equations are integrated numerically from high energy scales ($\lambda = \infty$) down to low scales ($\lambda = 0$), 
by incrementally stepping from $\lambda$ to $\lambda + d\lambda$. This integration continues until a phase transition is detected-signaled 
by the divergence of one of the interaction channels-or until a minimum value of $\lambda$ is reached. In the latter case, the system is considered to remain 
in a Fermi-liquid state. All such computations were performed on the high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at the University of St Andrews.

\subsection{Convergence of Calculation}
\label{subsec:convergence}
In the truncated-unity approximation, several convergence tests must be performed to ensure that calculations are accurate.
These tests include checking the form factor convergence and the number of $k$ points.

\subsubsection{Form factor convergence}

The set of orthogonal basis functions ($f_m$) used to describe the truncated space \textit{(See section \ref{subsubsec:Truncation scheme})}
in momentum representation is called the form factor basis\cite{lichtenstein2018functional}. In the case of the square lattice, 
the form factors take the form of delta functions in real space; they are arranged as circles with increasing radii around the origin. This effectively leads to a ``bond-like" representation where the form-factor cut-off
represents how many of the neighbouring bonds are accounted for in the calculation of each point in the phase diagram\textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:nknkf}a)}.\par

\medskip


\noindent The divERGe package allows the user to modify the form-factor cutoff accordingly. Choosing appropriate values ultimately comes down to a trade-off 
between computational accuracy and expensiveness. 
For the results in this project, the form factor value was set at 4\AA\footnote{This is equivalent to a number of form factor shells of 4 since the lattice spacing of the models here is set to 1\AA.} after the convergence of  
the calculations was tested accordingly for a range of points in the phase diagram \textit{(an example of such tests is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Formfactorconvergence} )}. Moreover, this value is in agreement with values used in previous literature\cite{lichtenstein2018functional}.

    \label{fig:Formfactorconvergence}
\end{figure}







\subsubsection{Convergence with number of k points }

When integrating the flow equation, there are two parameters that can be further tuned to ensure convergence.
These are the $n_k$ and $n_{k_f}$ values and they specify the number of k points used to carry out the nested integration of the decoupled flow equation. 
In particular, $n_k$ refers to the number of k points used for the general momentum integral, and $n_{k_f}$ to the number of k points used for 
the additional sum around each k-point \textit{See Fig.\ref{fig:nknkf}b}. The calculations performed here were carried out with an integration 
grid of 20x5 ($n_k$ x $n_{k_f}$) points. The choice of parameters ensured that the calculations had converged appropriately 
and resulted in an average computational time of $\approx 180s$ per point for the simpler models\footnote{Note that the computational time increases as a function of Coulumb repulsion $U$. }. 


\section{Results and discussion}

The findings of this project are presented across three sections, each dedicated to 
a different model: the nearest-neighbour, next-nearest-neighbour and nearest-neighbour
bi-orbital 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:2D Hubbard model})}. 
These sections explore the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, 
highlighting trends in the superconducting order parameter and spin density wave
ordering vectors. Additionally, they investigate how variations in parameters such as 
Coulomb repulsion, chemical potential, Hund's coupling, next-nearest-neighbor hopping, and the number of orbitals per site 
influence the critical temperature of the superconducting regions.

\subsection{Nearest-neighbour 2D Hubbard Model on a square lattice (1NN)}
\label{subsec:1NNModel}

\begin{figure}[htbp]  % Placement: Here, Top, Bottom, Page

    \label{fig:1NNpd}
\end{figure} 


The 1NN model is defined as the 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice with a single orbital per site,  allowing hopping between nearest-neighbour sites \textit{(a diagramatic representation can be found in Fig.\ref{fig:2D Hubbard model}.a)}. 
In this project the 1NN model is constructed by setting the nearest-neighbour hopping parameter to 1eV.
Fig.\ref{fig:1NNpd}a shows the band structure of the model along the high-symmetry points $\Gamma-X-M-\Gamma$ \textit{ (which correspond to a momentum path of $(0,0)-(\pi,0)-(\pi,\pi)-(0,0)$ along the square lattice)}.
The model has a bandwidth of 8 eV and exhibits a Van-Hove singularity \textit{(singularity in the density of states)} at the $M$ symmetry point \textit{$(\pi,\pi)$}. \par
\medskip


\noindent As discussed in Section \ref{subsec: HubbardModel}, solving this model near half-filling presents significant challenges. 
This section investigates the solution to the 1NN Model Hamiltonian using two-particle interaction-truncated FRG.
A phase diagram, plotted in terms of the on-site Coulomb repulsion 
$U$ and chemical potential $\mu$ is presented and analyzed in detail. While previous FRG studies on the 2D Hubbard model exist \cite{beyer2023rashba,hille2020quantitative,vilardi2020dynamical},
they mostly focus on specific regions of the phase diagram. As a result, there has been limited investigation into the effects of varying the on-site Coulomb repulsion.
The present work explores a much broader range of parameters than what has been previously studied: Coulomb repulsion values ranging from 1-20 eV 
and chemical potential values spanning the entire bandwidth of the model (from -4 eV to 4e V). \par

\medskip


\noindent Before diving into the results, it is important to be aware of several caveats. In real materials,  the chemical potential is a tuneable parameter due to its strong connection to the electronic doping of the system.
In turn, controlling the magnitude of the Coulomb repulsion between electrons is far from straightforward. 
Additionally, some interesting features discussed in this report fall outside the physical regime—specifically, the FRG calculation assumes a weak-coupling limit, meaning that any Coulomb 
repulsion values exceeding the bandwidth of the material (8 eV) are unphysical in this context.
Whilst unphysical, calculating these values is nevertheless insightful. It allows for further
understanding of the behaviour of FRG on electronic structure models, identifying the 
strengths and limitations of the technique. The primary goal in this project is to understand how variations in certain parameters \textit{($U$, $\mu$, $t'$)} influence the correlated phases observed in the model. 
Finally, it is also important to note, as discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:Truncation scheme}, that any analysis of the 
superconducting transition temperature should be treated qualitatively \textit{(at no point does this work claim to have identified superconducting 
regions with transition temperatures of the order of thousands of Kelvin)}.


\medskip
\noindent The complete phase diagram for the values discussed above is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1NNpd}. As is expected
for both the Hubbard model and the Cuprates\cite{kivelson1998electronic,fradkin2015colloquium,vanhala2018dynamical}, a pronounced competition between Magnetism and 
Superconductivity (SC) is observed. This interplay gives rise to a prominent magnetic dome, sandwiched between two narrower d-wave superconducting regions. This magnetic dome is 
anti-ferromagnetically (AFM) ordered and its width increases with increasing Coulumb repulsion is increased. In other words, a stronger Coulomb repulsion favours the magnetic instability as the ``leading ground state'' of this magnetism/SC competition 
for a larger range of doping values. Both AFM and d-wave SC arise from repulsive scattering between
($\pi$,0) and (0,$\pi$) vectors. Therefore, their competition peaks closest to the Van-Hove singularity, where both instabilities are amplified and mutually reinforced\cite{furukawa1998truncation,honerkamp2001temperature}.
Additionally, narrow magnetic stripes emerge at even-integer chemical potential values. At high values of $U$ -those that exceed the material's bandwidth- patches of a charge density wave (CDW) instability appear around regions of the superconducting dome.\par

\medskip

\noindent The results presented here align with previous studies of the two-dimensional Hubbard model. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) has 
previously captured the coexistence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and superconducting (SC) order parameters within the same solution across a range of doping levels (analogous to variations in 
$\mu$ in this work) in the weak-coupling regime\cite{capone2006competition}. A smooth transition between these two phases has also been reported \cite{capone2006competition}. However, the FRG treatment of the 2D 1NN Hubbard model has not been able to capture certain key features
of the cuprate phase diagram—namely, the Mott insulating phase and the emergence of the pseudogap that have been found in other studies of the 2D Hubbard model\cite{katanin2009comparing,otsuki2014superconductivity}.






\subsubsection{Superconductivity in the 1NN Model}

    the superconducting region of the phase diagram in Fig.\ref{fig:1NNpd}.  
    }
    \label{fig:1NNSC}
\end{figure}

Recent findings have claimed that the 1NN 2D Hubbard model does not have a superconducting ground state\cite{qin2020absence}. 
Whilst the model in Ref. \cite{qin2020absence} is the same as the 1NN model explored in this section, the paper's analysis is conducted in a 
slightly different framework than the one used in this project: using DMRG \cite{white1992density} 
at moderate-to-strong coupling and for values of U between 6-8 eV\textit{(the 
regime relevant to the cuprates)}.
The lack of superconductivity in their findings is attributed to a lack of competition 
between the magnetic and superconducting phases. Here, in the weak-coupling framework, both  competition between magnetism and superconductivity and 
a stabilised superconducting region is found. The superconducting order parameter in this stable region is plotted on top of the Fermi-Surface for the first BZ (Fig.\ref{fig:1NNSC}a).
The sign of the order parameter changes with respect to a 90 degree rotation and therefore one concludes that
the bulk superconducting region is d-wave symmetric. This is in agreement with what is expected from the Cuprate superconductors \cite{tsuei2000pairing}.\par
\medskip
\noindent 
After plotting the critical temperature ($T_c$) as a function of chemical potential ($\mu$) for a constant Coulumb repulsion($U$), one observes that
the superconducting critical temperature is maximised closest to the magnetic instability (Fig.\ref{fig:1NNSC}b).
This is in agreement with the idea that competition between instabilities
enhance the phase transition temperature \cite{maple1995interplay,sun2016dome}. Moreover, the magnitude of the Coulumb repulsion and Tc are positively correlated, as is to be expected from the assumed 
pairing mechanism \textit{(See Eq.\ref{Pairing interaction SF})}.





\subsubsection{Magnetic stripes in the 1NN Model}
\label{subsec:Stripes1NN}

    \label{fig:1NN_stripes}
\end{figure}


Another distinctive feature of the Cuprates \textit{(and of other unconventional superconductors}\cite{levi1998stripes}\textit{)} is 
the emergence of ``stripes" in their phase diagram. These are patterns of alternating
charge-density and spin density waves\cite{zachar1998landau, vojta2009lattice}. 
In the 1NN model discussed here, these patterns are not observed. However, magnetic regions of 
interest are found outside the main antiferromagnetic (AFM) dome. 
The 1NN phase diagram in Fig.\ref{fig:1NNpd} reveals what will henceforth be referred to as ``magnetic stripes" 
occurring at even integer values of the chemical potential ($\mu$). Most of them are ferromagnetically ordered and evolve to some commensurate 
nesting vector as the Coulomb repulsion is increased.\par
\medskip

\noindent The physics becomes particularly interesting at a chemical potential of $\mu =1.00eV$. 
In Cuprates, a doping of $\frac{1}{8}$th is known as ``the magic doping" \cite{komiya2005magic}, where
stripes emerge and superconductivity is suppressed. In this model, the magical doping corresponds 
to a chemical potential of $\pm 1.00eV$(which is $\frac{1}{8}$th of the bandwidth). 
At low Coulomb repulsion values, a ferromagnetically ordered spin density wave (SDW) is observed. This SDW is suppressed by a superconducting phase,
only to be revived at around $U \approx 15.00eV$, where it becomes antiferromagnetically ordered. The superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ increases along the stripe \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:1NN_stripes})}.
While this behaviour is not the same as the conventional stripes seen in Cuprates, it is fair to conclude that there is still something 
``magical" about the $\frac{1}{8}$ filling fraction in the 1NN model presented here. \par
\medskip

\noindent Before conducting this analysis, the possibility of the stripes being a computational artifact was ruled out.
This was done by increasing the $n_k$x$n_{k_f}$ resolution for a single point in the stripe and
confirming that the result remained unchanged. Additionally, the appearance of these stripes in other models in this report further confirms this.





\subsection{Effect of next-nearest neighbour hopping (1NNN model)}
\label{subsec:1NNNModel}

\begin{figure}[htbp]  % Placement: Here, Top, Bottom, Page

   }
    
    \label{fig:1NNN}
\end{figure}

In real materials, hopping isn't limited to nearest neighbours; next-nearest neighbour orbitals can also significantly overlap. This motivates the extension of the previously
discussed 1NN model to the next-nearest neighbour hopping 2D Hubbard model in a square lattice (1NNN model). 
Here, the next-nearest neighbour hopping amplitude is varied from 0-0.75 eV in steps of 0.25 eV.
The chemical potential of the models is adjusted to ensure that they are all
at half-filling in the undoped case. Introducing next-nearest neighbour hopping 
changes the electronic structure of the model (\textit{See Fig.\ref{fig:1NNN}a,b}). This results in notable
differences in the correlated phases observed in the phase diagrams in Fig.\ref{fig:1NNN}c.\par
\medskip

\noindent
As the next-nearest neighbour hopping is increased, the position of the Van-Hove singularity shifts to lower energies \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:1NNN}a)}. 
This increase in $t'$ also alters the Fermi-surface, which in turn changes the nesting vectors of the models. 
As a result of both these effects, the SC-SDW-SC sandwich 
region shifts toward the negative chemical potential regime as $t'$ increases.
The superconducting regions remain (in the most-part) d-wave symmetric and the emergence of 
magnetic stripes remains observable. Additionally, general trends in the superconducting transition
temperature ($T_c$) are also observed: it is maximised closest to the 
magnetic instability, and it increases as a function of $U$.\par
\medskip
\noindent Several studies have explored the effect of $t'$ in the 2D Hubbard model, 
employing both FRG \cite{husemann2012incommensurate} and other alternative methods \cite{fontenele2025effects}, 
with a particular focus on using $t'$ as a means to enhance $T_c$. The results presented here take a slightly different approach, aiming to 
compare the features of the 1NN and 1NNN phase diagrams.



\subsubsection{Superconductivity in the 1NNN Model}
\label{subsubsec:SC1NNN}

Including a next-nearest neighbour hopping parameter in the 1NN model does not lead to
many significant changes in the superconducting properties of the model. The order parameter is predominantly d-wave symmetric and the  superconducting temperature ($T_c$) increases
with Coulumb repulsion. Proximity to a Magnetic instability further enhances $T_c$.
Additionally, the same SC-SDW-SC sandwich structure is observed even after breaking particle-hole symmetry, reinforcing the 
idea that that superconductivity is favoured in the vicinity of a  spin density wave (SDW) instability. \par
\medskip
\noindent There are important differences between the superconducting regions in the 1NN and 1NNN model. 
Whilst the superconducting order parameter remains mostly d-wave symmetric in the 1NNN model, it is a different type
of d-wave symmetry than the one observed in the 1NN model. The 1NN model exhibits a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry; the 1NNN model
exhibits a $d_{xy}$ symmetry\cite{butler2012point}. The only difference between these two types of d-wave superconductivity the plane around which the order parameter is sign antisymmetric
\textit{(For direct comparison see Figs \ref{fig:1NNSC}c and \ref{fig:1NNNSC}b,c)}. 
Moreover,  $t' \neq 0 $, charge density wave (CDW) patches appear neighbouring some superconducting regions.
Specifically, when $\frac{t'}{t} = 0.75$, and for Coulumb repulsion between 8 and 11eV, the superconducting order parameter undergoes a more significant change.
Along these horizontal cuts there is a SCI-SDW-SCII-CDW transition \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:1NNNSC})}. The Superconducting order parameter 
is always d-wave symmetric in the SCI region and for most of the SCII region, but it abruptly transitions to 
s-wave symmetric in the vicinity of the CDW region \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:1NNNSC})}. This behaviour is also observed in the SC regions that neighbour CDW regions for 
the $t' = 0.25, 0.50eV$ models. To confirm whether this represents a physical phase transition, one would expect to experimentally observe a 
discontinuity as a result of an additional symmetry breaking when the order parameter shifts from s-wave to d-wave symmetry.

    c) and d) respectively.  }
    \label{fig:1NNNSC}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Magnetic stripes in the 1NNN model}
\label{subsec:Stripes1NNN}

The presence of magnetic stripes is another common feature shared by the 1NN and 1NNN models, 
further supporting their physical origin.
A summary of all the stripes and their respective nesting vectors is provided 
in Appendix \ref{appendix:A}. The locations of these
stripes suggest that their formation is a consequence of strong nesting at specific 
chemical potential values. 
Notably, the stripe at $\mu=1 eV$ in the 1NN model is the only example found where a strong 
competition between superconductivity and magnetism results in a change of Spin density wave (SDW) ordering.




\medskip 

\noindent While the transition from a Fermi liquid phase to any of the superconducting (SC), spin density wave (SDW), or charge density wave (CDW) phases is quite abrupt, the critical temperature
evolves more smoothly for stripes where there is a strong competition between SC and SDW/CDW instabilities \textit{(see Fig.\ref{fig:1NNNStripes})}. 
This is consistent with the discussion in Section \ref{subsec:Stripes1NN}. When $\frac{t'}{t} = 0.50$, a magnetic double dome emerges, becoming more pronounced as the Coulomb repulsion increases \textit{(see Fig.\ref{fig:1NNNDome})}. 
This is the pattern one might expect in the superconducting region, as observed in cuprates \cite{taillefer2010scattering}. 
However, this trend is only observed in this particular model and phase.

\end{minipage}



\subsubsection{Continuous variation of next-nearest neighbour hopping}

Section \ref{subsec:1NNModel} discusses the idea that the location of the 
Van Hove singularity is strongly related to the area of the phase diagram where the interplay between 
superconductivity and magnetism is most pronounced. In order to further support this, the critical temperature
is plotted as a function of chemical potential $\mu$ for different values of t' at U=7.00eV \textit{(See Fig.\ref{fig:tprimecont})}.
The magnetic region is pushed towards more negative values of the chemical potential as the value of the next-nearest 
neighbour hoping parameter is increased (and the van Hove singularity is pushed down in energy). The bulk magnetic
region remains anti-ferromagnetically ordered and the SC order parameter is predominantly d-wave symmetric. The exception occurs when
$t'$ is set to 0.70eV. There, the SC order parameter transitions to s-wave symmetric when it is closest to the boundary 
with the charge density wave (CDW) phase \textit{(as discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:SC1NNN})}.

\subsection{Effect of bi-orbital system (1NN2 model)}
\label{subsec:1NN2Model}

\noindent Most materials have more than one orbital per atom. This motivates the extension of the 
1NN model to a  biorbital nearest neighbour 2D Hubbard model in a square lattice (1NN2). This section explores the effect
of including two orbitals per site, focusing on the effect of mixing between different orbitals. For such, two different models are 
investigated: with and without different orbital mixing. To allow for future comparison with
existing literature\cite{sakakibara2024possible}, a choice of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{3z^2 -r^2}$ orbitals is made. 
The respective hopping parameters are determined using the  table of inter-atomic matrix elements calculated by J.C. Slater and G.F. Koster\cite{slater1954simplified}. 
In this calculation, the magnitudes of the $\sigma,  \pi, \delta$ bond strength  are approximated to  $\approx  1, 0.5, 0.05eV$ respectively in order to capture their relative values\cite{blanksby2003bond, mcgrady2015introduction, krapp2008strength}.
A table summarising the estimated parameters for the models discussed in this section is shown below.

\noindent For this discussion the chemical potential is fixed at both the undoped ($\mu = 0.00eV $) and doped ($\mu =1.00eV$) levels. The Coulumb repulsion and Hunds coupling strengths are varied from 1-10eV and 0.1-1.0eV, respectively.
The calculations were carried out using a form factor of 4\AA and an $n_k$x$n_{k_f}$ grid of 20x5. 
This section first discusses the 1NN2MY model, where orbital mixing between different orbitals is set to zero, and compares it later with the 1NN2MN model, which includes this orbital mixing. \par
\medskip
\noindent In the undoped case, the model exhibits an antiferromagnetically ordered spin density wave (SDW) ground state
for $U > 3.00eV$. When the coulomb repulsion is set to zero, the groundstate transitions to a charge density wave (CDW) with a $(\pi, \pi)$ nesting vector. 
Doping the system to a chemical potential of $\mu = 1.00eV$ suppresses the SDW, and instead, a small superconducting patch 
emerges in the boundary of the CDW phase \textit{(See Fig.{\ref{fig:1NN2pd}})}. The magnitude of the Hund's coupling has a minor effect in the dominating phase and its transition temperature  ($T_c$).
The Superconducting regions shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1NN2pd}.d exhibit different order parameters. The SC region at U=0.0eV is s-wave symmetric whilst the SC region at U =10.00eV
is d-wave symmetric. By comparing Figures \ref{fig:1NN2pd}c,d with e,f, it can be concluded that the inclusion of different orbital hopping promotes the emergence of a CDW phase at lower Coulomb repulsion values in the doped case with $\mu = 1.00eV$.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

This project aimed to investigate the interplay between Magnetism and Superconductivity in the 2D Hubbard Model at half-filling. The calculations were carried out
in the spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity framework using the two-particle truncated TU$^2$FRG scheme in the weak-coupling limit. Although this method
fails to capture correlated phases such as Mott-instulating or pseudo-gap phases, it is widely in agreement with previous literature. The results presented here provide
a comprehensive study of this model for a uniquely wide range of parameters. A strong competition between an
Antiferromagnetically-ordered SDW and d-wave symmetric SC phase is observed. 
Additionally, several strategies to stabilize and enhance the critical temperature of superconductivity are identified, including increasing the on-site Coulomb repulsion and being near a stabilized SDW region.
Narrow magnetic stripes are present, with their ordering changing at the "magical doping" value. The effect of including a next-nearest neighbor hopping parameter is examined in detail. Increasing $t'$ lowers the Van Hove singularity's energy, shifting the region of prominent SDW-SC interplay towards more negative chemical potentials.
A magnetic double dome emerges for a ratio of $\frac{t'}{t} = 0.50$.
The inclusion of $t'$ also leads to stable charge density wave (CDW) 
patches surrounding SC regions, where the SC order parameter transitions from d-wave to s-wave symmetry near these patches. 
Finally, a preliminary analysis is provided on extending these models to a 
two-orbital-per-site case. The AFM ground state is suppressed as the model is electronically doped, and the magnitude of Hund's 
coupling has minimal impact on the observed phases.\par


\medskip

\noindent Future work could involve a more in-depth analysis of the two-orbital-per-site model, potentially exploring broader ranges of 
chemical potential and Hund's coupling values. Additionally, extending the study to a bi-layer, two-orbital-per-site Hubbard model would be an intriguing direction. One could also investigate the 
impact of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the results obtained. Such extensions would quickly evolve into a multi-dimensional 
analysis, offering numerous avenues for exploration. However, a particularly relevant direction would be to progressively increase
the complexity of these models to better approximate the behavior of unconventional superconductors, 
such as lanthanum nickelate. This approach would involve a step-by-step examination of how the critical temperature ($T_c$) and superconducting 
regions change as model parameters evolve. Ultimately, this could provide valuable insights into the key parameters influencing superconducting 
phases in unconventional materials.
